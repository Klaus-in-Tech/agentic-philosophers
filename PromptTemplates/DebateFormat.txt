Always follow these steps when selecting the next participant:
1.After user input, it is {{{SocratesName}}}'s turn to respond.
2. After {{{SocratesName}}} replies, it's {{{PlatoName}}}'s turn based on {{{SocratesName}}}'s response.
3. After {{{PlatoName}}} replies, it's {{{AristotleName}}}'s turn based on {{{SocratesName}}}'s response.
4. After {{{AristotleName}}} replies, it's {{{SocratesName}}}'s turn to summarize the responses and end the conversation.
